The new [**Computer Graphics StackExchange**](http://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/)
website is on public beta!

I have joined the site when it was already in the commitment phase
on [Area 51](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/74985/computer-graphics),
and from what I've heard this is the second attempt at having the specialized network
about CG. It seems like this time it is going all the way.

So far, the site is looking like it's going to be very good addition to the SE
network, grouping a lot of useful knowledge and information in a single
place. I'm enjoying it and learning a lot from my CG peers over there,
so I recommend taking a look if you're interested in Computer Graphics,
be it offline or real-time. Take a tour and look at the top questions to
get a feel for it, then come and join in if you like what you see `;)`.
