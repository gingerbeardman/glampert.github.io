[Time flies][link_time]! Hard to believe I first started writing on this blog three years ago.
It was more then about time to give it a revamp and modernize the layout! Now blog
and my personal website are unified under the same platform and appearance, and are now also
much easier to modify and update, thanks to [Jekyll][link_jekyll], the engine that
powers these pages.

Hope you find the new layout and style pleasant and easy to use/navigate. It was
mostly done by me alone, so it is liable to have a few bugs `;)`.

The old URL, [blog.glampert.com](http://blog.glampert.com), is still 100% valid and points
correctly to this domain. The even older blogspot URLs are no longer valid though, so there
will be a few broken links, but hey, I don't really care about legacy `:P`.

So welcome to my new site/blog. Thanks for the visit and come back again!
