Just made the source code of SCS, a space-sim game I'm working on, [public](https://bitbucket.org/glampert/space-sim).
The game is in early prototyping phase, but has some basic features already implemented.
It uses a custom rendering engine based on OpenGL, also included in the repository linked above.

Game and engine are written in C++11 with heavy use of the Standard Library.
Some Lua code is also used for configuration.

Currently, the project is only building for Mac, so if you have a Mac, feel free to give it a try `;)`.
Also requires a modern video card with OpenGL 3+ to run.
