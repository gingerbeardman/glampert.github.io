Hi, my name is Lampert, and I know how to turn bits of strange colored text into pretty images in the computer screen.
In other words, I'm a Graphics Programmer. My main interest is in graphics and real-time rendering for games, but I also
like to work with low-level code and optimizations. I'm a C and C++ adept, but can also "speak" in several other programming
languages. Lately I've been fiddling with JavaScript, which has helped me build this very website!

I enjoy working with low-level, close-to-the-metal code. The inner workings of Game Engines,
libraries, and compilers interest me a lot too, as well as optimizing and improving code performance.
Recently, I've also played a bit with Console homebrew development and reverse engineering. Look in the
[blog section of this site][link_blog] and you'll find some of my writings about these endeavors.

Being up-to-date with the latest technologies and tools that arise in the world of computing is very
important, so I try to experiment whenever possible with different programming languages, tools and frameworks.
I place a lot of importance in code quality and architecture, trying to always follow the best programming
practices and patterns. My ultimate goal as a programmer is to write code that is well designed and implemented,
in a way that it will be easy to use and maintain and will be useful and functional for as long as it needs to be.
In account of this, it is only natural that I'm a big adept of the practice of code review. I'm an active user
of [CodeReview.SE][link_cr], one of the best sites in the whole StackExchange network, in my opinion. Anyone who
is seriously into programming should definitely pay it a visit and become a regular!

I'm always keen to hear about interesting and challenging job opportunities.
