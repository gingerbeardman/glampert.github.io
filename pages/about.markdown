Hi, my name is Lampert, and I know how to turn bits of strange colored text into pretty images in the computer screen.
In other words, I'm a Graphics Programmer. My main interest is in graphics and rendering for games, but I also like to
work with low-level platform specific code and optimizations. I'm a C and C++ adept, but can also "speak" in several
other programming languages. Lately I have been fiddling with JavaScript, which has helped me build this very website!

I learned to program with the C++ language and have been using it, together with C, for quite some time now, so I consider
myself to be a well experienced programmer. Gaming was always a passion for me, so back in 2009 I decided to start
taking a University course on Game Development and try to follow games as a career. Currently, I'm seeking for a job
in the games industry.

Graphics and real-time rendering are my main areas of interest in games, which lead me to acquire in-depth knowledge of
graphics APIs such as OpenGL and its variants (WebGL, OpenGL-ES, GLSL). I have some experience with Microsoft's Direct3D,
though I haven't kept up with the latest versions.

Graphics is not my only interest, I also enjoy working with low-level programming and platform specific code. I have
great interest in the inner workings of Game Engines and libraries, as well as in optimizing and improving code performance.
Recently, I have played a bit with Console homebrew development and reverse engineering. Look in the blog section of this site
and you'll find some of my writings about these endeavors.

I find it very important to be always up-to-date with the latest technologies and tools that arise in the world of computing,
so I try to experiment whenever possible with different programming languages, tools and frameworks. I also place a lot of importance
in code quality and architecture, trying to always follow the best programming practices and patterns. My main goal as a programmer
is to, ultimately, write code that is well designed and implemented, in a way that it will be easy to use and maintain and will be
useful and functional for as long as it needs to be. In account of this, it is only natural that I'm a big adept of the practice of
code review. I'm an active user of [CodeReview.SE][link_cr], one of the best sites in the whole StackExchange network, in my opinion.
Anyone who is seriously into programming should definitely pay it a visit and become a regular!

I'm currently open for job propositions. At the present date, I reside in the south of Brazil,
but I'm willing to relocate for the right opportunity; Location is not a concern for me.
