# My personal Website and Blog `@glampert.github.io`

Source code repository for my site/blog,
which can be found online at [(www.)glampert.com](http://glampert.com/)
or at the standard GitHub Pages URL [glampert.github.io](http://glampert.github.io).

It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the site from a set of static Markdown and HTLM
pages annotated with the [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) templating language.

[Pygments](http://pygments.org/) is used for source code syntax highlighting.

The included `Makefile` simplifies running Jekyll locally to test the site.
